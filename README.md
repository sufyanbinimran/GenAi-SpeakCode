# Speak to Code - Real-Time Voice to Code Generation

**Speak to Code** is an innovative project that converts real-time voice input into programming code in various languages. Leveraging **Whisper AI** for speech-to-text transcription and the **Gemini API** for code generation, this project enables users to dictate code in natural language and instantly receive code in languages like Python, JavaScript, C++, and more.

## Features
- **Voice Input**: Convert real-time spoken language into code.
- **Whisper AI**: Accurate speech-to-text transcription, supporting various languages and accents.
- **Gemini API**: Converts transcribed text into executable code in multiple programming languages.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Immediate conversion of speech into code, ready for execution or testing.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Generate code in Python, JavaScript, C++, and more.

## Technologies Used
- **Whisper AI**: Speech-to-text model for transcribing real-time voice input.
- **Gemini API**: AI-powered code generation based on natural language descriptions.
- **Python**: Used for handling backend processes and integration.
- **Flask/Django**: For creating a simple web interface (optional, based on your implementation).
- **WebSockets**: For real-time communication between voice input and code output.
